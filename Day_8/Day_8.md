### What is the DOM?

#### Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model):
- **Definition**: The Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. It essentially provides a way for programs to manipulate the content of a webpage.
- **Tree-Like Structure**: It's represented as a tree-like structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document.
- **Purpose**: Understanding the DOM helps in dynamically accessing, modifying, and updating the content and structure of web pages using JavaScript.

### DOM Tree

#### Hierarchical Structure of the DOM:
- **Nodes and Elements**: Understanding the concept of nodes where elements, attributes, and text within an HTML document are represented as nodes in the DOM tree.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Elements are organized in a parent-child relationship, forming a tree-like structure.
- **Example Visualization**: Drawing or visualizing a simple HTML document's DOM tree structure.

### Accessing Elements

#### Basic Methods for Accessing and Manipulating DOM Elements using JavaScript:
- **Document Object**: Accessing the DOM through the `document` object in JavaScript.
- **getElementById()**: Using this method to access an element by its ID.
- **getElementsByClassName()**: Retrieving elements by their class name.
- **getElementsByTagName()**: Obtaining elements by their tag name.
- **querySelector() and querySelectorAll()**: Introduction to more modern methods for element selection.

### Practical Exercise:
- Create a simple HTML file and experiment with accessing different elements using the methods learned.
- Use the browser console to interactively manipulate elements and view the changes in real-time.
