### Day 3: Basic Operators and Operations

#### Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
- **Familiarize with Arithmetic Operators**: 
  - Learn about basic arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
  - Understand how these operators work in JavaScript to perform mathematical operations.

```
// Arithmetic Operators
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

let addition = a + b; // Addition
let subtraction = a - b; // Subtraction
let multiplication = a * b; // Multiplication
let division = a / b; // Division
let modulus = a % b; // Modulus (Remainder)

console.log("Addition:", addition);
console.log("Subtraction:", subtraction);
console.log("Multiplication:", multiplication);
console.log("Division:", division);
console.log("Modulus:", modulus);
```

#### Task 2: Comparison Operators
- **Understand Comparison Operators**:
  - Explore comparison operators such as ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, and <=.
  - Learn how these operators are used to compare values and understand their distinctions and when to use them appropriately.

```
// Comparison Operators
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log("x == y:", x == y); // Equal to
console.log("x === y:", x === y); // Strict equal to (value and type)
console.log("x != y:", x != y); // Not equal to
console.log("x !== y:", x !== y); // Strict not equal to
console.log("x > y:", x > y); // Greater than
console.log("x < y:", x < y); // Less than
console.log("x >= y:", x >= y); // Greater than or equal to
console.log("x <= y:", x <= y); // Less than or equal to
```

#### Task 3: Logical Operators
- **Explore Logical Operators**:
  - Learn about logical operators including && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT).
  - Understand their usage in JavaScript for combining and evaluating conditions, allowing you to control the flow of your code based on different conditions.

```
// Logical Operators
let p = true;
let q = false;

console.log("p && q:", p && q); // Logical AND
console.log("p || q:", p || q); // Logical OR
console.log("!p:", !p); // Logical NOT
```

### Practice Suggestions:
- **Code Exercises**: Create simple programs using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to get a better grasp of their functionalities.
- **Real-world Examples**: Find practical applications of these operators in programming scenarios.
- **Code Challenges**: Solve problems utilizing these operators to solidify your understanding.
