### Day 5: Loops in JavaScript

#### For Loops
- **Syntax and Implementation**:
  - Understand the syntax and purpose of for loops in JavaScript.
  - Learn how to use for loops to perform repetitive tasks or iterate over arrays.
- **Practical Application**:
  - Practice iterating over arrays and performing various tasks using for loops to reinforce the concepts.

#### While Loops
- **Introduction to While Loops**:
  - Explore the syntax and functionality of while loops in JavaScript.
  - Understand their usage in executing code as long as a condition remains true.

#### Loop Control Statements (break and continue)
- **Using break and continue**:
  - Explore the use of break and continue statements within loops for control flow.
  - Understand how break stops the loop execution and how continue skips an iteration.

### Practice Suggestions:
- **For Loops Implementation**:
  - Write programs that use for loops to iterate through arrays or perform specific tasks repeatedly.
- **While Loops Exercises**:
  - Create scenarios where while loops are the most suitable for continuous execution based on conditions.
- **Using break and continue**:
  - Experiment with break and continue within loops to control their flow and understand their impact on program execution.
